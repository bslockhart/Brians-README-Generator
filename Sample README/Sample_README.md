## Description
When creating an open-source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app that can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project. The task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. This package follows the guidelines provided by the Professional README Guide and contains everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 

## Installation
Clone the main project then open the project folder in your text editor. Run 'npm install' in terminal to install node modules with all dependencies. Make sure you are in the main project folder using the 'cd' command. Then type in 'node index.js' or 'node index' to execute the application and load up the chain of prompts (questions). Answer all the prompts and once completed, your personal README.md file will be created.
