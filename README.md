### Instructions
1. Clone the main project then open up the project folder in your text editor.
2. Run 'npm install' in terminal to install node_modules with all dependencies.
3. Make sure you are in the main project folder using the 'cd' command.
4. Then type in 'node index.js' or 'node index' to execute the application and load up the chain of prompts (questions).
5. Answer all the prompts and once completed, your personal README.md file will be created.

### User Story
* AS A developer
* I WANT a README generator
* SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

### Challenge Guidelines
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

### Acceptance Criteria:
* GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
* WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
* THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
* WHEN I enter my project title
* THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
* WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions 
* THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests 
* WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
* THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
* WHEN I enter my GitHub username
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
* WHEN I enter my email address
* THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
* WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
* THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

## Mock Up
